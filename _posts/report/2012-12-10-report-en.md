##Executive Summary

OVD-Info is an independent human rights media project monitoring politically motivated arrests since December 2011. This report presents our statistical data on arrests, and analyzes the format of political activity, its themes, and organizers. A large part of the report is devoted to infringements that take place at the time of arrest, in police stations, and during court proceedings.

The report covers arrests in Moscow and several nearby cities between 4 December 2011, and 31 December 2012. It presents information on **5166 politically motivated arrests** during **228 events**, including **1312** arrests in December 2011, and **3854** in 2012.

**1079** people were detained at **20 events that were sanctioned by authorities**. During **208 events** that either were **not sanctioned**, or required no clearance, **4090** people were detained. The picket is the most common type of street activity; during 75 pickets we have registered 713 arrests. Rallies produced the greatest numbers of detainees. At 23 rallies, 1983 people were detained. The most frequent protest topic was solidarity with political prisoners (49 events resulting in 305 arrests). The most arrests were associated with general protest themes. During 44 events with anti-Putin slogans 1773 persons were detained. During 35 events against election fraud, the number of arrestees was 1750.

According to OVD-info’s data, the driving force behind protest is citizens and civic activists rather than particular organisations. Spontaneous events, as well as events organized by various groups of activists, form the majority of events registered by OVD-Info both in terms of their number and the number of arrestees: 137 events (60% of the total) either lack organizers, or are organized by independent activist groups; such events resulted in 2300 of detentions, or 44%.

Based on witness testimony by arrestees, we draw the following conclusions on rights violations during arrest. 

* Most arrests take place without prior warning from authorities that the detainee is in violation of the law; 
* Arresting officers fail to identify themselves or name the reason for arrest;
* The police widely practice unreasonable and unpunished violence during detention and subsequently in police precincts; 
* Journalists present at the scene on assignment are frequently detained; 
* Authorities at police stations routinely violate both the detainees' procedural rights, as well as substantive rights, such as the right to an attorney and to timely medical care. 

Using concrete examples we show how opposition rallies are forcibly dispersed (5 March 2012, and 6 May 2012).

Magistrates courts show a prosecutorial bias in their decisions on administrative charges against protestors. The proceedings take place with multiple procedural violations, which allow judges to convict suspects without sufficient proof. Despite the extremely low quality of the courts' work, in 94% of the cases appeal courts leave the lower court's ruling unchanged.

The methodological introduction to the report gives detailed definitions of the terms used, and the sources of data. Technical terms and references to laws are spelled out in the glossary. The introductory chapter, "Overview of detentions," describes the statistical information on political detentions gathered and analyzed by OVD-Info. Infographics and maps are shown in a separate section of the report. Elsewhere the report is structured by section to reflect the activist's experiences in the order in which they take place in a typical detention. In the chapter entitled "The course of detention" we show typical causes of detentions, and give specific examples of rights violations. The chapter "Violations in the OVD" illustrates the detainees' experiences at the police precinct. The final chapter of the Report covers court proceedings. An attempt to quantify the relationship between the number of detentions and the number of detainees is made in the appendix ("How many people experienced detention"). The chapter on "Criminal charges against detainees" is also placed in the appendix, because such occurrences are not related to administrative detentions, although they have a direct effect on the behavior of activists and police officers during detention. The raw data on which the report is based are available in table format, or in csv file format.

##Preface

In December 2011, more than a year ago, our society was shaken up by the new experience of mass political arrests. Just over three days in Moscow, more than 1000 people were detained. Some spent several days at police stations; dozens of people were jailed for two weeks. These events may not strike an observer of current Russian events as extraordinary, and ordinary things do not shock us. At the time, however, this was a new experience for most of those involved, a physical experience of captivity. This experience shook up the authors of this report as well. Since those events in December, we monitor all political arrests in Moscow on a daily basis.

OVD-info is an independent human rights media project set up to monitor political arrests. Our project is apolitical in the sense that we are not part of the protest movement, nor do we favour a particular political force in our work. Still, we have ideological benchmarks, so to speak: first and foremost, the law, and specifically Article 31 of the Russian constitution, which guarantees the freedom of assembly. Secondly, we follow the Soviet dissident experience, especially *The Chronicle of Current Events*, a Samizdat bulletin which reported on human rights abuses in the USSR between 1968 and 1983. Finally, we are inspired by the French philosopher Michel Foucault, who created the Prison Information Group in 1971 on the basis that discussion of prison should be framed by the accounts of prisoners, not of jailers.

The subject of our interest is less terrifying than Russian prisons in general. But lack of freedom is always a lack of freedom. Detention in a police station is not meaningfully different from any other modes of captivity. It is important that we can learn much about this particular type from detainees themselves.

Everything we learn is immediately published on our website. This information is used by hundreds of media organizations, alleviating the most dangerous element of the lack of freedom: the lack of voice, the information vacuum. Today, after more than a year of observation, we are bringing together and analyzing these data and this knowledge. Why?

We believe that information and knowledge can bring change. In fact, the description in detail of current practice, using concrete examples and testable statistics, is a change in itself. Before the system can change, we must change our perception of it. For starters, we must understand the system and understand the changes that are needed. On the basis of our report, legislators—in the future, if not presently—can see some of the weaknesses of our police and judicial system. This is important, because if the police practice vicious beatings and other violations against political detainees (who are aware of their rights and who are the target of attention by the media), then it is difficult to imagine the experience of the hundreds of thousands of ordinary detainees, who cannot count on the attention of the press, nor on the help of lawyers and human rights activists. We urge experts and politicians to take our report seriously, and to use our data in legislative and civic initiatives.

A side effect of gathering data on political detentions is a general picture of protest activity. However, we should caution readers who are not versed in social science against drawing direct conclusions from our data, since they only describe political detentions, and their use to research political activity in general is impossible without the context of a broader set of data. For this reason, we ourselves avoid drawing conclusions. That being said, we welcome any use of our data by journalists, social and political scientists in their publications and research. We believe in open access, and make our data available in a format that can be easily adapted to a variety of research needs.

We went through a lot emotionally while monitoring political detentions and working on this report. The knowledge and understanding that resulted from it have left their mark; we have changed. Even if we keep to a dry, fact-oriented language in our report, we hope that it will change you as well.

##Our data and methodology

Both the qualitative and the quantitative data used in this report is based primarily on information that OVDinfo received directly from arrestees or their defence counsels, or from eyewitnesses. We collected our data using the OVDinfo hotlines which people rang while being arrested, as well as using an online form on our website. One exception to this is the data on arrests between 4 and 10 December 2011, which is based on reports in the media and other by other human rights organisations such as Solidarnost’ and Memorial. Our qualitative data consists of testimony by and interviews with arrestees published by OVDinfo, mass media, or by the arrestees themselves on social media. 

OVDinfo monitors arrests which we consider both unlawful and politically motivated. By ‘unlawful’ we mean that police officers are in breach of regulations when arresting and/or charging a protestor. We exclude from our summary data the rare cases of lawful arrest, where activists themselves where in breach of Russian regulation, that is, in particular when they have used violence against the police or other citizens.  
By ‘politically motivated’ we mean the circumstances of arrest, namely that the arrestee was at a political action or rally, or was putting up political posters or handing out flyers, or an entirely unmotivated arrest of a person who is known for their political activities. We define ‘politics’ in the wider sense of defending one’s rights and interests: this means we include actions dedicated to environmental issues, LGBTQ rights, in defence of public spaces and welfare provisions. 

Our statistics on the number of arrests in Moscow for the period of December 2011 – December 2012 are practically exhaustive. However, it is possible that individual actions or arrests of particular activists have escaped our monitoring. Other data collected by OVDinfo is incomplete: e.g. we do not have statistics on all court decisions, and not every case of police violence towards arrestees was recorded during monitoring. Therefore our analysis of infringements during arrests and at police stations is qualitative rather than statistical.  
Qualitative data included in this report is primarily based on OVDinfo’s materials and are provided as illustrations of violations of particular rights of arrestees and norms of Russian legislation, rather than providing a complete list of such infringements over the reporting period in Moscow. 

Sources are indicated with a hyperlink in the online version of this report and with a footnote in the PDF version. Where the source of data is not indicated, the interviews were conducted specifically for this report. Raw data that forms the basis of summary statistics, infographics and maps, [are presented in table](http://reports.ovdinfo.org/2012/data/en).

In our data actions are classified according to their stated aims (by theme) and format (by type). Both these classifications are evidently subjective, so the groupings offered in this report can be revised depending on the research question. 

In the map of arrests by police station, the overall number of arrests is smaller than in our summary statistics because we do not have complete data on arrests between 4 and 10 December 2011. Geographically the report concerns arrests taking place in Moscow and several nearby cities (Khimki, Zhukovsky, Zheleznodorozhny, Troitsk). We do not include data on arrests in other towns and cities because OVDinfo’s existing data on them is nowhere near complete. The appendix on criminal cases includes some cases from a wider time period and from outside the Moscow region.

Terms and pieces of legislation are explained at first use and fully listed in the **Glossary**.

##Overview of arrests 

From the start of mass political protest on **4 December 2011** and up to **31 December 2012** OVD-info tracked **5166 politically motivated arrests** at 228 protest events in and around Moscow. **1312** of these arrests took place in December 2011, 3856 - in the year 2012.

Data visualization allows to see the general picture of the protests from the point of view of arrests  (All Arrests slide), development of street activity over time (Arrests Timeline), a breakdown of protest events by organizer (Event Organizers) and types (Event Types), as well as the sanctioned or unsanctioned status of the events (Event Official Status). Colours represent event topics, circle sizes represent the number of people arrested. The raw data with information sources are available as a summary table (Table 1, Initial Data).

###Event Types

During the inquiry period OVD-Info tracked 228 events. In this report an "event" means an arrest of one or more persons, associated by the same geographical and thematic circumstances. It should be noted that this term implies not only street protests where arrests took place, but also a number of specific cases of politically motivated arrests that took place outside of protest actions.

The general distribution of events by type is presented in Figure 1. The Event Types slide (http) shows the same data combined with a thematic attribution of each event and the number of people arrested. Table 2 shows the correlation between the number of people arrested and the event type.

The goal of the classification of events by type in this report is to show which types of events draw the most arrests. The development of forms of street protest is a separate research topic which our data is insufficient to cover. 
###Specific Arrest Cases

OVD-Info recorded **78** arrests during **17 promotional actions** – events of this type are marked as "Agitation" in the OVD-info database. **17 activists** were arrested during **10 special police operations** – these events are marked as "Activist". **70** people were arrested during **15 unclassified events** ("Other").

“Agitation” in this context refers to distribution of political materials of general interest or promoting a specific political event. Examples include [people arrested during for distributing the report "Putin. The Conclusions" produced by the Solidarity movement on 23 February 2012](http://ovdinfo.org/express-news/122) and [activists arrested on 2 May 2012 for distributing flyers about the 6 May March of the Millions](http://ovdinfo.org/express-news/397).   

Special police operations marked as "Activist" are arrests of activists that took place outside any public political action. For example, [on 28 November 2012  several Other Russia activists party were arrested in the Moscow subway](http://ovdinfo.org/express-news/1114) – which prevented them from marking the anniversary of Other Russia’s newspaper Limonka.

The "Other" category consists of arrests that took place under unusual circumstances. [These include the arrest of Makulatura band musicians at a performance on August 5th 2012](http://ovdinfo.org/express-news/878) and [the arrest of passers-by with a poster reading "Happy Birthday" whom the police mistook for members of the protest camp #OccupyArbat](http://ovdinfo.org/express-news/641).

###Street Event Types

The most common type of street events during the reviewed period is picketing – OVD-info recorded **713 arrests** at **75 pickets**, which makes up 33% of all recorded events. 

‘Picketing’ in Russian normally means a form of protest, sanctioned or unsanctioned by authorities, with one or more people present, without a stage or sound amplification, marching or direct action. But in this report the defining criteria for picketing are also the following: a) having a specific cause; b) taking place in a pedestrian area and c) in close proximity to the institution that is the object of protest. Examples of events in this category are: regular picketing of the Investigative Committee in support of the people accused of rioting in the May 6th Bolotnaya square case; picketing of the State Duma against the new assembly legislation and the law against adoption of Russian children by US citizens; numerous events in support of Pussy Riot that took place outside the Moscow courts during the hearings of the band's case. Despite the fact that they are not fully consistent with our definition of picketing, a number events organized by Other Russia near the Novokuznetskaya metro station are also included in the category – mainly because they were officially sanctioned as pickets and fall under the judicial definition of picketing.

Despite the fact that a one-person picket does not require a permit in Russia, in the course of the reviewed period **28 arrests** during **9 one-person pickets** were recorded. This contradiction is due to the fact that one of the common protest practices in Moscow are series of one-person pickets united by theme, time, and sometimes even space (in which case the participants usually keep a reasonable distance from one another). Besides, sometimes the police arrests two people during a one-person protest – for example, when one passes their poster to the other (see **Sanctioned and unsanctioned events** for details).

During **33 direct actions and performances** we recorded **415 arrests** recorded by OVD-Info. Direct action is conventionally defined as action aiming to interfere with the target of the protest directly rather than symbolically. We have also included theatrical or performance actions in this category. 

OVD-Info recorded **1984 arrests** at **23 rallies**. We define rallies as mass protests unified by the same theme and space regardless of the event's official status. Rallies can be held with or without a stage and sound amplification. We distinguish a rally from a picket by the following criteria: a rally is not necessarily held in close proximity to the target of protest, it does not have a specific topic, and/or its site is not exclusively pedestrian. The fact that the most arrests were recorded at rallies is due to, firstly, mass arrests during some of the sanctioned rallies for fair elections, as well as the fact that we classify the series of unsanctioned Strategy-31 protests on Triumfalnaya square as rallies.

4**84 arrests** were recorded by OVD-info during **4 marches**. A march in this report is an event with coordinated movement of the participants along a pre-defined route, regardless of the event's official status.

There are certain difficulties in classifiying events that fall on the boundaries of event types. The line between a march and an organized walk (‘stroll’) is rather vague. It is even harder to distinguish organized walks from the series of events, extended in both time and space, that received the label ‘occupy’. (Translator’s note: these protests also were, for most of their participants, not affiliated with the transnational Occupy movement). Nonetheless, both ‘stroll’ and ‘occupy’ are firmly rooted in the language that defines street protests in Moscow in 2011-2012, notably in the self-designation by their organizers. This is the reason for adapting three terms in this report – ‘stroll’, ‘stroll/occupy’, and ‘occupy’, – and the attribution of an event depends not only on formal criteria, but on the self-definition as well.

In the course of **6 strolls, 72 arrests** were recorded. As opposed to marches, events of this type do not imply receiving a formal permission from the authorities. They do not have a specific pre-defined route and the participants do not coordinate their movements, do not form blocs and participate in the event individually. 

In the course of 1**1 events we classify as stroll/Occupy**, we recorded **1033 arrests**. This category consists of two event types, that significantly differ from one another in format: one the one hand this is the series of ‘White Ribbon Walks’ on the Red Square, which in format and ideology were something in between the Strategy-31 actions and strolls. On the other hand it's the ‘White City’ event of 7 May 2012. This action was planned  as a stroll not attached to a particular geographic spot, but because of a rough dispersal by the police it turned into a series of short Occupy-style events, carrying on for three days, and covering the whole Moscow city center.

Finally, during **Occupy events** OVD-info recorded **18 instances of dispersals or arrests** of individual protesters, with a total of **235 arrests**. We define ‘occupy; events using the following set of criteria: a) 24-hour presence of protesters; b) no set theme; c) lack of single organizer, self-organization of participants or competing groups of organizers. These criteria are met by the #OccupyAbai on Chistoprudnyi boulevard near the Abai Qunanbaiuli monument, the #OccupyArbat on Arbat Street near the Bulat Okudzhava monument, and #OccupyBarricades in the park on Kudrinskaya Square. Arrests of activists who were moving from one of these locations to the other are added to this category. Events that took place later and had the word "occupy" in their title like #OccupyMUR (Moscow criminal police), #OccupySK (Investigative Committee) in this report are considered to be picketing. The tent camp of several Pussy Riot supporters known as #OccupyCourt is attributed to "Other".

OVD-info also monitored **7 incidents** with a total of **40 arrests in eco-camps**. 6 of the cases were recorded in the Tsagovskiy forest defenders’ camp in Zhukovskiy, and there was one case with 6 arrests in the Khimki forest defenders’ camp. By ‘eco-camps’ we mean environmental protest actions extended in time and occupying a space in a non-urban environment.
