##Executive Summary

OVD-Info is an independent human rights media project monitoring politically motivated arrests since December 2011. This report presents our statistical data on arrests, and analyzes the format of political activity, its themes, and organizers. A large part of the report is devoted to infringements that take place at the time of arrest, in police stations, and during court proceedings.

The report covers arrests in Moscow and several nearby cities between 4 December 2011, and 31 December 2012. It presents information on **5166 politically motivated arrests** during **228 events**, including **1312** arrests in December 2011, and **3854** in 2012.

**1079** people were detained at **20 events that were sanctioned by authorities**. During **208 events** that either were **not sanctioned**, or required no clearance, **4090** people were detained. The picket is the most common type of street activity; during 75 pickets we have registered 713 arrests. Rallies produced the greatest numbers of detainees. At 23 rallies, 1983 people were detained. The most frequent protest topic was solidarity with political prisoners (49 events resulting in 305 arrests). The most arrests were associated with general protest themes. During 44 events with anti-Putin slogans 1773 persons were detained. During 35 events against election fraud, the number of arrestees was 1750.

According to OVD-info’s data, the driving force behind protest is citizens and civic activists rather than particular organisations. Spontaneous events, as well as events organized by various groups of activists, form the majority of events registered by OVD-Info both in terms of their number and the number of arrestees: 137 events (60% of the total) either lack organizers, or are organized by independent activist groups; such events resulted in 2300 of detentions, or 44%.

Based on witness testimony by arrestees, we draw the following conclusions on rights violations during arrest. 

* Most arrests take place without prior warning from authorities that the detainee is in violation of the law; 
* Arresting officers fail to identify themselves or name the reason for arrest;
* The police widely practice unreasonable and unpunished violence during detention and subsequently in police precincts; 
* Journalists present at the scene on assignment are frequently detained; 
* Authorities at police stations routinely violate both the detainees' procedural rights, as well as substantive rights, such as the right to an attorney and to timely medical care. 

Using concrete examples we show how opposition rallies are forcibly dispersed (5 March 2012, and 6 May 2012).

Magistrates courts show a prosecutorial bias in their decisions on administrative charges against protestors. The proceedings take place with multiple procedural violations, which allow judges to convict suspects without sufficient proof. Despite the extremely low quality of the courts' work, in 94% of the cases appeal courts leave the lower court's ruling unchanged.

The methodological introduction to the report gives detailed definitions of the terms used, and the sources of data. Technical terms and references to laws are spelled out in the glossary. The introductory chapter, "Overview of detentions," describes the statistical information on political detentions gathered and analyzed by OVD-Info. Infographics and maps are shown in a separate section of the report. Elsewhere the report is structured by section to reflect the activist's experiences in the order in which they take place in a typical detention. In the chapter entitled "The course of detention" we show typical causes of detentions, and give specific examples of rights violations. The chapter "Violations in the OVD" illustrates the detainees' experiences at the police precinct. The final chapter of the Report covers court proceedings. An attempt to quantify the relationship between the number of detentions and the number of detainees is made in the appendix ("How many people experienced detention"). The chapter on "Criminal charges against detainees" is also placed in the appendix, because such occurrences are not related to administrative detentions, although they have a direct effect on the behavior of activists and police officers during detention. The raw data on which the report is based are available in table format, or in csv file format.

##Preface

In December 2011, more than a year ago, our society was shaken up by the new experience of mass political arrests. Just over three days in Moscow, more than 1000 people were detained. Some spent several days at police stations; dozens of people were jailed for two weeks. These events may not strike an observer of current Russian events as extraordinary, and ordinary things do not shock us. At the time, however, this was a new experience for most of those involved, a physical experience of captivity. This experience shook up the authors of this report as well. Since those events in December, we monitor all political arrests in Moscow on a daily basis.

OVD-info is an independent human rights media project set up to monitor political arrests. Our project is apolitical in the sense that we are not part of the protest movement, nor do we favour a particular political force in our work. Still, we have ideological benchmarks, so to speak: first and foremost, the law, and specifically Article 31 of the Russian constitution, which guarantees the freedom of assembly. Secondly, we follow the Soviet dissident experience, especially *The Chronicle of Current Events*, a Samizdat bulletin which reported on human rights abuses in the USSR between 1968 and 1983. Finally, we are inspired by the French philosopher Michel Foucault, who created the Prison Information Group in 1971 on the basis that discussion of prison should be framed by the accounts of prisoners, not of jailers.

The subject of our interest is less terrifying than Russian prisons in general. But lack of freedom is always a lack of freedom. Detention in a police station is not meaningfully different from any other modes of captivity. It is important that we can learn much about this particular type from detainees themselves.

Everything we learn is immediately published on our website. This information is used by hundreds of media organizations, alleviating the most dangerous element of the lack of freedom: the lack of voice, the information vacuum. Today, after more than a year of observation, we are bringing together and analyzing these data and this knowledge. Why?

We believe that information and knowledge can bring change. In fact, the description in detail of current practice, using concrete examples and testable statistics, is a change in itself. Before the system can change, we must change our perception of it. For starters, we must understand the system and understand the changes that are needed. On the basis of our report, legislators—in the future, if not presently—can see some of the weaknesses of our police and judicial system. This is important, because if the police practice vicious beatings and other violations against political detainees (who are aware of their rights and who are the target of attention by the media), then it is difficult to imagine the experience of the hundreds of thousands of ordinary detainees, who cannot count on the attention of the press, nor on the help of lawyers and human rights activists. We urge experts and politicians to take our report seriously, and to use our data in legislative and civic initiatives.

A side effect of gathering data on political detentions is a general picture of protest activity. However, we should caution readers who are not versed in social science against drawing direct conclusions from our data, since they only describe political detentions, and their use to research political activity in general is impossible without the context of a broader set of data. For this reason, we ourselves avoid drawing conclusions. That being said, we welcome any use of our data by journalists, social and political scientists in their publications and research. We believe in open access, and make our data available in a format that can be easily adapted to a variety of research needs.

We went through a lot emotionally while monitoring political detentions and working on this report. The knowledge and understanding that resulted from it have left their mark; we have changed. Even if we keep to a dry, fact-oriented language in our report, we hope that it will change you as well.
