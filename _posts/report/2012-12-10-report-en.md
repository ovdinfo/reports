##Executive Summary

OVD-Info is an independent human rights media project monitoring politically motivated arrests since December 2011. This report presents our statistical data on arrests, and analyzes the format of political activity, its themes, and organizers. A large part of the report is devoted to infringements that take place at the time of arrest, in police stations, and during court proceedings.

The report covers arrests in Moscow and several nearby cities between 4 December 2011, and 31 December 2012. It presents information on **5166 politically motivated arrests** during **228 events**, including **1312** arrests in December 2011, and **3854** in 2012.

**1079** people were detained at **20 events that were sanctioned by authorities**. During **208 events** that either were **not sanctioned**, or required no clearance, **4090** people were detained. The picket is the most common type of street activity; during 75 pickets we have registered 713 arrests. Rallies produced the greatest numbers of detainees. At 23 rallies, 1983 people were detained. The most frequent protest topic was solidarity with political prisoners (49 events resulting in 305 arrests). The most arrests were associated with general protest themes. During 44 events with anti-Putin slogans 1773 persons were detained. During 35 events against election fraud, the number of arrestees was 1750.

According to OVD-info’s data, the driving force behind protest is citizens and civic activists rather than particular organisations. Spontaneous events, as well as events organized by various groups of activists, form the majority of events registered by OVD-Info both in terms of their number and the number of arrestees: 137 events (60% of the total) either lack organizers, or are organized by independent activist groups; such events resulted in 2300 of detentions, or 44%.

Based on witness testimony by arrestees, we draw the following conclusions on rights violations during arrest. 

* Most arrests take place without prior warning from authorities that the detainee is in violation of the law; 
* Arresting officers fail to identify themselves or name the reason for arrest;
* The police widely practice unreasonable and unpunished violence during detention and subsequently in police precincts; 
* Journalists present at the scene on assignment are frequently detained; 
* Authorities at police stations routinely violate both the detainees' procedural rights, as well as substantive rights, such as the right to an attorney and to timely medical care. 

Using concrete examples we show how opposition rallies are forcibly dispersed (5 March 2012, and 6 May 2012).

Magistrates courts show a prosecutorial bias in their decisions on administrative charges against protestors. The proceedings take place with multiple procedural violations, which allow judges to convict suspects without sufficient proof. Despite the extremely low quality of the courts' work, in 94% of the cases appeal courts leave the lower court's ruling unchanged.

The methodological introduction to the report gives detailed definitions of the terms used, and the sources of data. Technical terms and references to laws are spelled out in the glossary. The introductory chapter, "Overview of detentions," describes the statistical information on political detentions gathered and analyzed by OVD-Info. Infographics and maps are shown in a separate section of the report. Elsewhere the report is structured by section to reflect the activist's experiences in the order in which they take place in a typical detention. In the chapter entitled "The course of detention" we show typical causes of detentions, and give specific examples of rights violations. The chapter "Violations in the OVD" illustrates the detainees' experiences at the police precinct. The final chapter of the Report covers court proceedings. An attempt to quantify the relationship between the number of detentions and the number of detainees is made in the appendix ("How many people experienced detention"). The chapter on "Criminal charges against detainees" is also placed in the appendix, because such occurrences are not related to administrative detentions, although they have a direct effect on the behavior of activists and police officers during detention. The raw data on which the report is based are available in table format, or in csv file format.

##Preface

In December 2011, more than a year ago, our society was shaken up by the new experience of mass political arrests. Just over three days in Moscow, more than 1000 people were detained. Some spent several days at police stations; dozens of people were jailed for two weeks. These events may not strike an observer of current Russian events as extraordinary, and ordinary things do not shock us. At the time, however, this was a new experience for most of those involved, a physical experience of captivity. This experience shook up the authors of this report as well. Since those events in December, we monitor all political arrests in Moscow on a daily basis.

OVD-info is an independent human rights media project set up to monitor political arrests. Our project is apolitical in the sense that we are not part of the protest movement, nor do we favour a particular political force in our work. Still, we have ideological benchmarks, so to speak: first and foremost, the law, and specifically Article 31 of the Russian constitution, which guarantees the freedom of assembly. Secondly, we follow the Soviet dissident experience, especially *The Chronicle of Current Events*, a Samizdat bulletin which reported on human rights abuses in the USSR between 1968 and 1983. Finally, we are inspired by the French philosopher Michel Foucault, who created the Prison Information Group in 1971 on the basis that discussion of prison should be framed by the accounts of prisoners, not of jailers.

The subject of our interest is less terrifying than Russian prisons in general. But lack of freedom is always a lack of freedom. Detention in a police station is not meaningfully different from any other modes of captivity. It is important that we can learn much about this particular type from detainees themselves.

Everything we learn is immediately published on our website. This information is used by hundreds of media organizations, alleviating the most dangerous element of the lack of freedom: the lack of voice, the information vacuum. Today, after more than a year of observation, we are bringing together and analyzing these data and this knowledge. Why?

We believe that information and knowledge can bring change. In fact, the description in detail of current practice, using concrete examples and testable statistics, is a change in itself. Before the system can change, we must change our perception of it. For starters, we must understand the system and understand the changes that are needed. On the basis of our report, legislators—in the future, if not presently—can see some of the weaknesses of our police and judicial system. This is important, because if the police practice vicious beatings and other violations against political detainees (who are aware of their rights and who are the target of attention by the media), then it is difficult to imagine the experience of the hundreds of thousands of ordinary detainees, who cannot count on the attention of the press, nor on the help of lawyers and human rights activists. We urge experts and politicians to take our report seriously, and to use our data in legislative and civic initiatives.

A side effect of gathering data on political detentions is a general picture of protest activity. However, we should caution readers who are not versed in social science against drawing direct conclusions from our data, since they only describe political detentions, and their use to research political activity in general is impossible without the context of a broader set of data. For this reason, we ourselves avoid drawing conclusions. That being said, we welcome any use of our data by journalists, social and political scientists in their publications and research. We believe in open access, and make our data available in a format that can be easily adapted to a variety of research needs.

We went through a lot emotionally while monitoring political detentions and working on this report. The knowledge and understanding that resulted from it have left their mark; we have changed. Even if we keep to a dry, fact-oriented language in our report, we hope that it will change you as well.

##Our data and methodology

Both the qualitative and the quantitative data used in this report is based primarily on information that OVDinfo received directly from arrestees or their defence counsels, or from eyewitnesses. We collected our data using the OVDinfo hotlines which people rang while being arrested, as well as using an online form on our website. One exception to this is the data on arrests between 4 and 10 December 2011, which is based on reports in the media and other by other human rights organisations such as Solidarnost’ and Memorial. Our qualitative data consists of testimony by and interviews with arrestees published by OVDinfo, mass media, or by the arrestees themselves on social media. 

OVDinfo monitors arrests which we consider both unlawful and politically motivated. By ‘unlawful’ we mean that police officers are in breach of regulations when arresting and/or charging a protestor. We exclude from our summary data the rare cases of lawful arrest, where activists themselves where in breach of Russian regulation, that is, in particular when they have used violence against the police or other citizens.  
By ‘politically motivated’ we mean the circumstances of arrest, namely that the arrestee was at a political action or rally, or was putting up political posters or handing out flyers, or an entirely unmotivated arrest of a person who is known for their political activities. We define ‘politics’ in the wider sense of defending one’s rights and interests: this means we include actions dedicated to environmental issues, LGBTQ rights, in defence of public spaces and welfare provisions. 

Our statistics on the number of arrests in Moscow for the period of December 2011 – December 2012 are practically exhaustive. However, it is possible that individual actions or arrests of particular activists have escaped our monitoring. Other data collected by OVDinfo is incomplete: e.g. we do not have statistics on all court decisions, and not every case of police violence towards arrestees was recorded during monitoring. Therefore our analysis of infringements during arrests and at police stations is qualitative rather than statistical.  
Qualitative data included in this report is primarily based on OVDinfo’s materials and are provided as illustrations of violations of particular rights of arrestees and norms of Russian legislation, rather than providing a complete list of such infringements over the reporting period in Moscow. 

Sources are indicated with a hyperlink in the online version of this report and with a footnote in the PDF version. Where the source of data is not indicated, the interviews were conducted specifically for this report. Raw data that forms the basis of summary statistics, infographics and maps, [are presented in table](http://reports.ovdinfo.org/2012/data/en).

In our data actions are classified according to their stated aims (by theme) and format (by type). Both these classifications are evidently subjective, so the groupings offered in this report can be revised depending on the research question. 

In the map of arrests by police station, the overall number of arrests is smaller than in our summary statistics because we do not have complete data on arrests between 4 and 10 December 2011. Geographically the report concerns arrests taking place in Moscow and several nearby cities (Khimki, Zhukovsky, Zheleznodorozhny, Troitsk). We do not include data on arrests in other towns and cities because OVDinfo’s existing data on them is nowhere near complete. The appendix on criminal cases includes some cases from a wider time period and from outside the Moscow region.

Terms and pieces of legislation are explained at first use and fully listed in the **Glossary**.

##Overview of arrests 

From the start of mass political protest on **4 December 2011** and up to **31 December 2012** OVD-info tracked **5166 politically motivated arrests** at 228 protest events in and around Moscow. **1312** of these arrests took place in December 2011, 3856 - in the year 2012.

Data visualization allows to see the general picture of the protests from the point of view of arrests  (All Arrests slide), development of street activity over time (Arrests Timeline), a breakdown of protest events by organizer (Event Organizers) and types (Event Types), as well as the sanctioned or unsanctioned status of the events (Event Official Status). Colours represent event topics, circle sizes represent the number of people arrested. The raw data with information sources are available as a summary table (Table 1, Initial Data).

###Event Types

During the inquiry period OVD-Info tracked 228 events. In this report an "event" means an arrest of one or more persons, associated by the same geographical and thematic circumstances. It should be noted that this term implies not only street protests where arrests took place, but also a number of specific cases of politically motivated arrests that took place outside of protest actions.

The general distribution of events by type is presented in Figure 1. The Event Types slide (http) shows the same data combined with a thematic attribution of each event and the number of people arrested. Table 2 shows the correlation between the number of people arrested and the event type.

The goal of the classification of events by type in this report is to show which types of events draw the most arrests. The development of forms of street protest is a separate research topic which our data is insufficient to cover. 
###Specific Arrest Cases

OVD-Info recorded **78** arrests during **17 promotional actions** – events of this type are marked as "Agitation" in the OVD-info database. **17 activists** were arrested during **10 special police operations** – these events are marked as "Activist". **70** people were arrested during **15 unclassified events** ("Other").

“Agitation” in this context refers to distribution of political materials of general interest or promoting a specific political event. Examples include [people arrested during for distributing the report "Putin. The Conclusions" produced by the Solidarity movement on 23 February 2012](http://ovdinfo.org/express-news/122) and [activists arrested on 2 May 2012 for distributing flyers about the 6 May March of the Millions](http://ovdinfo.org/express-news/397).   

Special police operations marked as "Activist" are arrests of activists that took place outside any public political action. For example, [on 28 November 2012  several Other Russia activists party were arrested in the Moscow subway](http://ovdinfo.org/express-news/1114) – which prevented them from marking the anniversary of Other Russia’s newspaper Limonka.

The "Other" category consists of arrests that took place under unusual circumstances. [These include the arrest of Makulatura band musicians at a performance on August 5th 2012](http://ovdinfo.org/express-news/878) and [the arrest of passers-by with a poster reading "Happy Birthday" whom the police mistook for members of the protest camp #OccupyArbat](http://ovdinfo.org/express-news/641).

###Street Event Types

The most common type of street events during the reviewed period is picketing – OVD-info recorded **713 arrests** at **75 pickets**, which makes up 33% of all recorded events. 

‘Picketing’ in Russian normally means a form of protest, sanctioned or unsanctioned by authorities, with one or more people present, without a stage or sound amplification, marching or direct action. But in this report the defining criteria for picketing are also the following: a) having a specific cause; b) taking place in a pedestrian area and c) in close proximity to the institution that is the object of protest. Examples of events in this category are: regular picketing of the Investigative Committee in support of the people accused of rioting in the May 6th Bolotnaya square case; picketing of the State Duma against the new assembly legislation and the law against adoption of Russian children by US citizens; numerous events in support of Pussy Riot that took place outside the Moscow courts during the hearings of the band's case. Despite the fact that they are not fully consistent with our definition of picketing, a number events organized by Other Russia near the Novokuznetskaya metro station are also included in the category – mainly because they were officially sanctioned as pickets and fall under the judicial definition of picketing.

Despite the fact that a one-person picket does not require a permit in Russia, in the course of the reviewed period **28 arrests** during **9 one-person pickets** were recorded. This contradiction is due to the fact that one of the common protest practices in Moscow are series of one-person pickets united by theme, time, and sometimes even space (in which case the participants usually keep a reasonable distance from one another). Besides, sometimes the police arrests two people during a one-person protest – for example, when one passes their poster to the other (see **Sanctioned and unsanctioned events** for details).

During **33 direct actions and performances** we recorded **415 arrests** recorded by OVD-Info. Direct action is conventionally defined as action aiming to interfere with the target of the protest directly rather than symbolically. We have also included theatrical or performance actions in this category. 

OVD-Info recorded **1984 arrests** at **23 rallies**. We define rallies as mass protests unified by the same theme and space regardless of the event's official status. Rallies can be held with or without a stage and sound amplification. We distinguish a rally from a picket by the following criteria: a rally is not necessarily held in close proximity to the target of protest, it does not have a specific topic, and/or its site is not exclusively pedestrian. The fact that the most arrests were recorded at rallies is due to, firstly, mass arrests during some of the sanctioned rallies for fair elections, as well as the fact that we classify the series of unsanctioned Strategy-31 protests on Triumfalnaya square as rallies.

4**84 arrests** were recorded by OVD-info during **4 marches**. A march in this report is an event with coordinated movement of the participants along a pre-defined route, regardless of the event's official status.

There are certain difficulties in classifiying events that fall on the boundaries of event types. The line between a march and an organized walk (‘stroll’) is rather vague. It is even harder to distinguish organized walks from the series of events, extended in both time and space, that received the label ‘occupy’. (Translator’s note: these protests also were, for most of their participants, not affiliated with the transnational Occupy movement). Nonetheless, both ‘stroll’ and ‘occupy’ are firmly rooted in the language that defines street protests in Moscow in 2011-2012, notably in the self-designation by their organizers. This is the reason for adapting three terms in this report – ‘stroll’, ‘stroll/occupy’, and ‘occupy’, – and the attribution of an event depends not only on formal criteria, but on the self-definition as well.

In the course of **6 strolls, 72 arrests** were recorded. As opposed to marches, events of this type do not imply receiving a formal permission from the authorities. They do not have a specific pre-defined route and the participants do not coordinate their movements, do not form blocs and participate in the event individually. 

In the course of 1**1 events we classify as stroll/Occupy**, we recorded **1033 arrests**. This category consists of two event types, that significantly differ from one another in format: one the one hand this is the series of ‘White Ribbon Walks’ on the Red Square, which in format and ideology were something in between the Strategy-31 actions and strolls. On the other hand it's the ‘White City’ event of 7 May 2012. This action was planned  as a stroll not attached to a particular geographic spot, but because of a rough dispersal by the police it turned into a series of short Occupy-style events, carrying on for three days, and covering the whole Moscow city center.

Finally, during **Occupy events** OVD-info recorded **18 instances of dispersals or arrests** of individual protesters, with a total of **235 arrests**. We define ‘occupy; events using the following set of criteria: a) 24-hour presence of protesters; b) no set theme; c) lack of single organizer, self-organization of participants or competing groups of organizers. These criteria are met by the #OccupyAbai on Chistoprudnyi boulevard near the Abai Qunanbaiuli monument, the #OccupyArbat on Arbat Street near the Bulat Okudzhava monument, and #OccupyBarricades in the park on Kudrinskaya Square. Arrests of activists who were moving from one of these locations to the other are added to this category. Events that took place later and had the word "occupy" in their title like #OccupyMUR (Moscow criminal police), #OccupySK (Investigative Committee) in this report are considered to be picketing. The tent camp of several Pussy Riot supporters known as #OccupyCourt is attributed to "Other".

OVD-info also monitored **7 incidents** with a total of **40 arrests in eco-camps**. 6 of the cases were recorded in the Tsagovskiy forest defenders’ camp in Zhukovskiy, and there was one case with 6 arrests in the Khimki forest defenders’ camp. By ‘eco-camps’ we mean environmental protest actions extended in time and occupying a space in a non-urban environment.

###Topics

The OVD-Info database contains 49 various activities dedicated to support of political prisoners or arrestees (marked as ‘political prisoners’).

The second and third most common protest topics are general. The topic of the electoral fraud and demand for fair elections were predominant before the presidential election on 4 March 2012 (35 events marked as ‘for fair elections’). After the elections, the agenda became less specific, but reflecting a more radical attitude towards the ruling elite – 44 events in the report are marked as ’anti-Putin’, as Vladimir Putin personifies the negative characteristics of the current political system for protestors. As Table 3 shows, approximately equal numbers of people were detained during the first general protest wave (’for fair elections’) and the second wave (‘anti-Putin’). 

19 events were dedicated to solidarity with the detained members of the band Pussy Riot. It is worth mentioning here that the arrest of the band members themselves, which happened after a performance on Lobnoe Mesto on 20 January 2012 falls under the topic “Anti-Putin”. 

The Moscow Occupy events are thematically attributed in this report as ‘occupy”, since one of our criteria for this type of event is its lack of single subject. In the opinion of the authors of this report, in the format of Occupy events, the form is more important than the contents, therefore the number of the events of this format (18 Occupy events) is the same as the number of the events with this subject (18 events).

“Strategy-31” rallies form their own category. These are protests with the demand to uphold the 31st Article of the Russian Constitution (the freedom of assembly), normally held on the 31st calendar day of any month on Triumfalnaya Square. The number of events we report with this subject in the reported period (10) is larger than the number of Strategy-31 rallies, since a number of Other Russia activists were detained twice near the Moscow Mayor's office at actions demanding the Mayor to agree to sanction a Strategy-31 event. 

The categories of Environmental (9 events) and Social (6 events) topics contain actions with corresponding demands. Actions in defense of Khimki and Tsagovsky forests are tagged as environmental, while actions dedicated to education reform and the topic of infill construction are tagged as social topics.

5 events in the reported period targeted the toughening of the legislation on public events. This topic is tagged as “Against the law on rallies”. 3 events were dedicated ban on adoption by US citizens (subject line “Against the anti-Magnitsky Law”).

2 actions for the rights of LGBTQ people are tagged with the abbreviation LGBTQ; 2 anti-fascist actions are tagged as ‘antifa’.

‘Other’ topics - 26 events in the reporting period – include both events dedicated to a specific if rare topic (for instance, “Yabloko” party against military conscription, or picketing the US embassy due to the situation with Radio Liberty), as well as arrests of activists outside public events, and other exceptional cases of arrests. 

###Organisers

The full list of protest organisers and the breakdown of numbers of arrests by organiser of protest are presented in Table 4 and the Organisers slide. 

Picture 3 shows that there was no absolute organisational leader of street protests, since the largest proportion of events (99 out of 228) did not have an identifiable organiser. Such activities are tagged as ’spontaneous’. Our criterion for this classification is the lack of a formal institutional organizer (a political party or thematic or organisational committee) or of an easily identifiable non-institutional organising group of activists. The second criterion of a spontaneous event is its numerousness. As a rule, one or another group of activists unrelated to institutional actors is behind the less-numerous protests which occur without a formal organiser. Such events in this report fall into the ‘Other’ organiser category. This category is the second largest, with 38 events. It is worth mentioning that due to our inability to establish for certain the lack of a single organizer of unsanctioned events, there may be a certain proportion of mistaken attribution to the ‘spontaneous’ and ‘other’ categories.   

Overall, spontaneous events and those organized by various groups of activists (‘Other’) comprise the vast majority of the events documented by OVD-info, both by number and by  arrest count: 137 events (60% of the total) have no identifiable organiser or were organised by independent activist groups. 2,300 arrests (44%) took place at these events.

The organisers of 40 events (17%, with 2,088 arrests, or 40%), were somehow formally related to the general protest movement (Protest Actions Organizing Committee, Coordination Council, The 23rd of August Organizing Committee, Solidarity Movement, The Left Front, The Protest Actions Workshop, Rosagit, The 6 May Committee).

Among the institutional actors taking part in the general protest movement, Solidarity is the leading organiser of autonomous events – 14 events (6%) and 485 arrests (9%).

Among the institutional actors outside of the general protest movement, the most events were organised by the non-registered party Other Russia: 23 events (10%) and 193 arrests (less than 4%).

It is worth mentioning that despite the common understanding that Other Russia organises the Strategy-31 rallies, they are in fact a coalition project of several political actors. Their organiser is the Strategy-31 committee. For 8 Strategy-31 rallies (3% of events) there were 429 arrests (8%).

###Geography of Arrests 

We have mapped arrests by the police stations the arrestees were taken to. It is worth noting that the number of arrests on the map is less than in the overall OVD-info statistical database, since we do not have the full information about the arrests between 4-10 December 2011. Over the reporting period, OVD-info documented 5,166 detentions, and the map by  by police station considers 4,269 of them. 

The overall number of police stations engaged in political arrests in the reporting period is 87. Out of them, 68 are local police stations of districts of Moscow (internal affairs departments, OVD in Russian), 16 are Line Internal Affairs Departments (police stations at train and metro stations), and 3 are police stations outside of the city. 

***The largest numbers of arrestees were brought to Basmannyi (372 arrestees), Tverskoy (365), and Presnenskiy (262) police stations.***

###Sanctioned and unsanctioned protests

Politically motivated arrests take place at actions and rallies as well as during other political activities. Arrests occur at both sanctioned and unsanctioned actions. By ‘sanctioned action’ we mean protests where the organisers have sought permission from the relevant local authority, which is required by Russian law for any protest where more than one person is holding up placards or banners. During the period in question, we have registered 1079 arrests at sanctioned protests and 4087 at unsanctioned ones. It has to be said that the unsanctioned character of an event does not mean that it is not peaceful: all events monitored by OVDinfo were entirely peaceful, except for the (sanctioned) March of the Millions on 6 May 2012 (which ended in violent clashes with the police).

During the large sanctioned rallies (5 December 2011, 5 March 2012, 10 March 2012, 12 September 2012) arrests primarily begin after the end of the main event, if part of its participants decide to carry it on in another format. 

On 5 December 2011 participants supported the call from the stage to “take a walk to Lubyanka metro station”, resulting in the arrest of about 300 people.

On 5 March 2012 Sergei Udaltsov suggested the protestors do not leave the site of the rally, and the protest continued in the form of a meeting with Duma deputy Ilya Ponomaryov. (Under current legislation, meetings with Duma deputies are one form or public event which requires no sanction from public authorities.) The meeting was violently shut down by riot police and about 200 people were detained.

Likewise, on 10 March and 12 September Sergey Udaltsov was detained alongside several others after Udaltsov made the suggestion of continuing the event in a different (still lawful) format. [On 12 September Udaltsov was detained before the stated end of the sanctioned rally](http://ovdinfo.org/express-news/979). 

Also noteworthy are the arrests of Other Russia activists at a series of sanctioned protests outside of Novokuznetskaya metro station in the summer of 2012. Every time, police officers used force to detain participants of these sanctioned protests, providing the reason that the activists’ placards were not consistent with the stated topic of the protest. For example, on 29 June 2012, [“Detained at a sanctioned protest next to Novokuznetskaya metro station: activists of Other Russia Dmitry Kolesnikov, Evgeny Petrov, Georgiy Dorokhov, Vitaliy Krayev, Rostislav Barsukov, as well as journalist and blogger Shelkovenkov. According to one of the activists, those detained are the organisers of the protest as well as everybody who held on to a banner. The arrestees have been brought back to Zamoskvorechye police station”](http://ovdinfo.org/express-news/812).

A special case is the shutdown of the sanctioned march on 6 May 2012, which turned into police violence, arrests and later criminal cases against participants of the march. In this report we are not ready to give an overall evaluation of the events on Bolotnaya square that day, however we can testify that [the police used excessive force on the arrestees](http://ovdinfo.org/resource/otchet-upolnomochennogo-po-pravam-cheloveka-o-nablyudenii-za-publichnymi-meropriyatiyami-v-), and [the arrests themselves took place illegally](http://ovdinfo.org/article/6-maya-zaderzhannykh-izbivali-mnogie-popali-v-bolnitsu-doklad-onk).

Arrests at actions which do not legally require to be sanctioned by a local authority (such as single person protest or collective strolling without chanting or placards) take place either without any legal basis, or are explained by formalistic reasons. In this way, [on 27 October 2012 Sergey Udaltsov, Alexei Navalny, Sergey Parkhomenko, Maksim Sannikov, Ekaterina Mochalova and one other person were detained during their “stroll against repression and torture”. All of them were walking along the street without placards or chanting, or stood on their own outside a building (which is allowed as a single person picket).](http://ovdinfo.org/express-news/1067). [On 24 November 2012 Sergey Sharov-Delone and Oleg Pykhtin were detained at the one-person picket “Tomorrow they will come for you!”: Sharov Delone was holding up a placard, Pykhtin approached him, and the two were immediately arrested.](http://ovdinfo.org/express-news/1103). 
>[On 24 March 2012 “two participants of a protest in memory of Sergey Magnitsky were detained by police outside the Ministry of the Interior on Kaluzhskaya Square ... The two women were in breach of conditions of one-person picket: they displayed placards within only 10 metres of each other. The activists quickly fixed the error and removed one of the two placards, nevertheless the police detained both the placard holders”](http://ovdinfo.org/express-news/265)

Overall, despite the strictness of Russian laws on public actions, many of the forms of street action that OVD-info covered over the year are not regulated by law. We consider arrests during the ‘strolls’ and Occupy actions in May, as well as arrests during “white-ribbon strolls” or at one-person pickets, to be fundamentally illegal due to the absence of corresponding prohibitions in Russian legislation. 

The overwhelming majority of arrests happen at unsanctioned actions which the authorities deem to require sanctioning, such as the Strategy-31 demonstrations on Triumfalnaya Square (taking place every 31st day of any month), various performances and flash-mobs, or last-minute mass protests outside courts and other state institutions. The decision to shut down such actions clearly has a political, context-dependent character. Identical situations may lead to the decision to shut an event down, or not. In this way, [people gathered outside a court to support the entrepreneur Alexey Kozlov were not detained (probably to avoid extra publicity), whereas every court hearing on the Pussy Riot case led to arrests](http://ovdinfo.org/article/delo-pussy-riot-khronika-zaderzhanii).

##In the course of arrest

An overwhelming majority of arrests take place without the arrestee being forewarned of their breach of the law. During arrest, police officers do not identify themselves or state the reason for arrest. Operatives of the Centre for Anti-Extremism are usually present at opposition actions and point out activists to be detained by police. Police officers regularly use excessive force. (**ССЫЛКА на соотв.раздел**).

Testimony by Daniil Faizov, detained on 18 March 2012 at the protest “against NTV’s vicious lies” at the television centre in Ostankino: 

>[“After approximately 10 minutes I was nicked (I was not resisting and was acting politely). I did not chant, did not shout. Police officers did not identify themselves, [I] do not recognise their faces, to my reasonable question “What [are you arresting me] for?” they answered “They’ll tell you [when you get] there.”](http://ovdinfo.org/article/stikhi-dlya-maiora)

[On 22 April 2012 an activist was arrested on the Red Square for unravelling a banner reading “Russia without Chains”: “The arresting officer, a lieutenant colonel, declined to introduce himself, as he believes that the law on police does not demand this of him”](http://ovdinfo.org/express-news/378). On 13 June 2012 journalists protesting against the threats to a colleague from the head of the Investigative Committee Bastrykin were arrested outside this government institution. [“Olga Bychkova reports on Twitter that the arresting police officers declined to identify themselves.”](http://ovdinfo.org/express-news/778). The refusals to identify and to name the reason for arrest are so systematic that they are routinely omitted from OVD-info reporting.

For every one arrestee, there is normally one to four arresting officers from a variety of agencies – these may be OMON (riot police), the 1st or 2nd operative regiments, or officers of Moscow police. Commonly arrests take a form that is demeaning and undermines the arrestee’s dignity: in multiple recorded cases arrestees are dragged from or to the paddy wagon along the tarmac, many get carried by the legs and arms.

On 7 October 2012, participants of a “freedom stroll” were detained in Aleksandrovsky Garden: [“Police officers dragged Zinovkina, Sannikov, Drovetsky and Dergachev along the ground”](http://ovdinfo.org/express-news/1023). On 11 October 2012 [“Vera Lavreshina was dragged out of Kitai Gorod police station along the wet tarmac”](http://ovdinfo.org/express-news/1037). 

Testimony by an arrestee from 5 May 2012, Pushkinskaya Square:

>[“Two OMON officers grab my feet, now three of them are carrying me. The one who held [me] by the shoulders for some reason lets go, I hang upside down. In the sky below me I see dark outlines of journalists and camera lenses. Then the world turns upside down. Next to me some guys are being forcefully thrown against the wall of the paddy wagon. And I’m pushed inside.”](http://ovdinfo.org/article/ne-stranu-razvalivaem-zashchishchaem-spravedlivost) 

Depending on the action, arrests may be indiscriminate or may be targeted according to police command instructions. Arkadiy Babchenko, arrested on 6 December 2012 at Triumfalnaya Square, testifies: 
>[“So I stood around for an hour or an hour and a half, then a major walks past with two [officers] and says “Take this one too””](http://ovdinfo.org/resource/babchenko-nichego-ne-menyaetsya-lyudi-sidyat)  

Anti-extremism centre operatives are present during most of arrests. [“While the police bus stood near Kitai Gorod police station, the well-known E centre operative Alexei Okopny came into the bus and took away Dmitry Smirnov, Pavel Shekhtman, Sergey Zaplavny and Dmitry Kolesnikov”](http://ovdinfo.org/express-news/100).

Commonly the stated reason for arrest is the presence of opposition symbols such as white ribbons. Ilya Vorontsov, arrested on 7 May 2012 at Lubyanka: 

>[“We had white ribbons tied to our clothes. We had not reached the event yet when two ‘astronauts’ [police in riot gear] emerged from an underpass, one of them saw my white ribbon and approached me with the words “Young man, let’s go!”](http://ovdinfo.org/article/gorozhane-vs-omon-salki-dubinki-na-vesu)

Arrests in cafes became a 2012 novelty.

Journalist Asya Chachko, arrested on 7 May 2012:

>[“Having smashed up [cafe] Jean-Jacques, the chain of OMON moved us and the customers of all the nearby cafes to Nikitsky Gates, and took away the writer Lev Rubinshteyn, Grani.Ru editor-in-chief Vladimir Korsunsky, two girls from Kommersant, Masha Shubina from the Yeltsin Foundation, and another ten or so people into paddy wagons.”](http://ovdinfo.org/article/gorozhane-vs-omon-salki-dubinki-na-vesu) 

On 23 December 2011 police arrested two activists who were handing out promotional materials for the demonstration for fair elections to be held on 24 December, in a club in Moscow. [“Anna Shabalkova and Alexey Shichkov were detained in a club in central Moscow with no explanation offered. The volunteers were sitting at a table, a stack of freshly printed leaflets was on the tabletop. The arrestees are being brought to Meshanskoye police station”](http://ovdinfo.org/express-news/46). Similar situations [repeated with Other Russia activists](http://ovdinfo.org/express-news/855).

###Types of arrests 

The most common type of arrest is “delivery to police station with the aim of filing a protocol”. In most cases, the arrestees are charged with article 20.2 of the Administrative Offences Code of the Russian Federation (Violation of the established procedure for the organisation or carrying out of a meeting, demonstration, rally, march, or picket, punishable by a fine of up to 30 thousand roubles). Regularly arrestees are also charged with article 19.3 AOC RF (failure to obey a lawful order of a police officer, punishable by up to 15 days’ administrative detention). 

Article 19.3 AOC RF is not often used by police station officers simultaneously with article 20.2 AOC RF, despite the fact that the refusal to comply with a lawful order of a police officer at a public event can only occur only if a law was being violated in the first place (such as article 20.2 AOC RF). In most cases article 19.3 AOC RF is used for a harsher sentence for the arrestee, for example if they asserted their rights, or were beaten up during arrest or at the police station.

[On 30 October 2012 Other Russia activists intended to meet the mayor of Moscow Sergey Sobyanin to demand that he remove fences from Triumfalnaya Square (the fences prevent Strategy-31 rallies from taking over the square). 8 activists were detained and then released from the police station without protocols](http://ovdinfo.org/express-news/1078), except [Vasily Krayev who was charged with article 19.3](http://ovdinfo.org/express-news/1079) and kept under arrest overnight. During arrest, the police officers had hit Krayev’s head on a lamppost. 

If the arrestee is charged with article 20.2 AOC RF, they must be released from the police station within three hours, whereas charged with article 19.3 a person can be kept in the police station awaiting trial for 48 hours. On 5 December 2011, 5 March 2012 and 6 May 2012 most of the arrestees were charged with article 19.3, and courts backdated their days of detention as punishment by administrative arrest.

The use of any other legislation is relatively rare, although sometimes activists receive article 20.1 AOC RF (petty hooliganism) or a range of articles of the Moscow Administrative Offences Code in relation to sticking up flyers or other printed materials.

[On 14 March 2012 activists Nikolay Lyaskin, Roman Tkach, Pavel Shekhtman and Daniil Kogtev were detained in Bolshoi Kozikhinskiy alley at a protest against construction works there. Presnensky police station charged them with article 20.1 AOC RF (petty hooliganism)](http://ovdinfo.org/express-news/211).

[On 30 August 2012 two people detained next to the Investigative Committee during a protest in solidarity with political prisoners were charged for sticking up flyers with article 8.13 of Moscow AOC: “unsanctioned posting of information on objects”](http://ovdinfo.org/express-news/938).

There are also “soft” arrests, which are not in any way regulated by Russian legislation and have no legal consequences for the arrestee. Their most common type is the “delivery to police station” for the purpose of writing “an explanatory note”, an ID check or a “cautionary conversation”. 

[On 27 April 2012, seven people were detained on Red Square for handing out political materials. They were taken to Kitai Gorod police staion and released without protocols having signed explanatory notes](http://ovdinfo.org/express-news/390). [On 3 May 2012 Aleksandr Myslenkov was detained at a sanctioned rally for handing out leaflets and “delivered to police station for an ID check” (http://ovdinfo.org/express-news/398) On 17 June 2012 people arrested at an Other Russia protest were released from Zamoskvorechye police station “following a cautionary conversation”](http://ovdinfo.org/express-news/796).

After 6 May 2012 another kind of legally dubious arrest has appeared: “verification of involvement in riots on the 6th of May”. This was the formulation used for holding in police stations most of the people arrested during Moscow’s Occupy-style protests in May-June. In our opinion, these arrests explain the “thousands of witness accounts on the Bolotnaya case” referred to by the Investigative Committee. For example, [on 19 August 2012 activist Maksim Vinyarsky was detained at a sanctioned meeting for wearing a balaclava. Later he was “released from Presnenskoye police station without charge. The reason for arrest was verification of involvement in the 6th of May riots”](http://ovdinfo.org/express-news/926).

Organisers of sanctioned protests also get detained for exceeding the declared head count. [On 19 January 2012 “following the end of the anti-fascist march in memory of Anastasiya Baburova and Stanislav Markelov, police officers detained Yuliya Bashinova, one of the declarants of the action.” She was brought to Tverskoye police station and “charged with violation of the sanctioned procedure for the action, in particular, exceeding the declared head count for the event (300 people), as per article 20.2 part 1 of AOC RF”](http://ovdinfo.org/express-news/80).

Arrests of political activists outside of actions or protests sometimes are explained by a ‘wanted’ notice. [On 26 June 2012 a Solidarity activist Pavel Yelizarov was detained “for a formal resemblance to a burglar” and “brought to Yakimanka police station for a search with witnesses”](http://ovdinfo.org/express-news/810). [Andrey Lukyanov was detained for two days in a police station because of his formal resemblance to Voina group activist Oleg Vorotnikov](http://ovdinfo.org/express-news/638).

Arrests of accidental passers-by are not uncommon. [On 24 May 2012 the police detained a group of birthday party goers on Arbat Street: “According to an eyewitness from the #occupyarbat camp, the party were detained because they had large greeting cards and they came close to the camp – at this point the police noticed and immediately detained”](http://ovdinfo.org/express-news/641).


Two cases of politically motivated arrests in 2012 stand out from this overall typology. On 4 August 2012 surveyor Nikolai Pomeshenko, who led a project counting up attendees of protest demonstrations, and an Agora association barrister were arrested on Bolotnaya Square during a game of petanque. [“The search and detention were motivated by suspicion of drug sales. The arrestees were brought to Yakimanka police station, and from there to a ‘narcological survey’”](http://ovdinfo.org/express-news/877). [On 5 August 2012 two musicians from the band Makulatura were detained in Baumansky garden during a performance “containing negative [remarks] towards Putin and the police”](http://ovdinfo.org/express-news/879). Both musicians were charged with petty hooliganism (article 20.1 AOC RF) and fined.
