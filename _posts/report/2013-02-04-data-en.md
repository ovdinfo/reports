In our data events are classified according to their stated aims (by theme) and format (by type). Both these classifications are evidently subjective, so the groupings offered in this report can be revised depending on the research question.  You can use the data straight from the table, or [download data in CSV format](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AqL_R49TiUuAdGpDMUphai0wemI4NXBkQ3BBUTJpYWc&single=true&gid=0&output=csv).
