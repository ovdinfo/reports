##Executive Summary

Between 1 January and 31 March 2013, there were at least 250 arrests in the course of 41 events in Moscow and suburbs. In terms of arrestee numbers, this is three times less arrests than during the same period in 2012: during the first quarter of last year there were at least 782 arrests in the course of 42 events. The same can be said in comparison to the previous months (October-December 2012): during the last quarter of last year there were 317 arrests during 44 events.

This quarterly report by OVD-info shows the following main trends:

- There are fewer arrests at a stable number of events
- More criminal cases are being opened against arrestees
- In terms of causes, ‘general’ protest  is going down, and social justice themes are becoming dominant 

Nearly a quarter of all events monitored by OVD-info in this period were dedicated to social justice, and most of the arrests (100) took place at these events. The next most popular topic is solidarity with political prisoners: during 8 events dedicated to this theme (20% of all events) there were 52 arrests.

*Pic. 1: Protest topics (january - march 2013)* 

65% of all events were either spontaneous (7 events) or were organised by informal activist groups (20 events in “other” category). During the same period in 2012, spontaneous or informal organisation accounted for 14 events (33% of all events in that period); during the last quarter of 2012, these two categories accounted for 32 events, or 71% of all.

##Criminal cases and persecution of particular activists

At least four events resulted in criminal cases being opened. After an action in defence of the social housing block belonging to Moscow Silk company on 18 January, 3 people were arrested. Underage Maxim Mitulinsky was charged with part 2 of article 116 of the Criminal Code (“beating motivated by hooliganism”). On 19 January another action took place at the same housing block, resulting in 39 arrests. Hooliganism criminal cases (article 213 CC) were opened against several arrestees. Activists Grachya Pogosov and Igor Polozenko are under house arrest. On 8 March during an authorised feminist rally there were 24 arrests. An article 318 criminal case (“using violence against a representative of the state”) was opened against Anastasiya Bryazgina. On 18 March the action “F... off with your registration!” on the Red Square in Moscow resulted in 15 arrests and a hooliganism criminal case (article 213 CC). In April a case under article 318 (“using violence against a representative of the state”) was opened against Mitulinsky and Yevgeniy Bestayev, another defendant of the Moscow Silk block.

Except for the Bolotnaya Case (following from the violent dispersal of a mass rally on 6 May), during all of 2012 OVD-info recorded only one criminal case against an arrestee: Stanislav Pozdnyakov was arrested on a protest stroll on the Red Square on 1 April 2012, was charged and in 2013 convicted to two years’ probation under article 318 CC (“using violence against a representative of the state”).

There have also been significantly more cases of arrest of political activists outside of public events: during the first three months of 2013 OVD-info registered seven such incidents, with ten activists arrested. During the same period of 2012, there was only one incident of an activist being arrested outside of a protest event. During the previous quarter (October-December 2012) there were three such incidents leading to eight individual arrests.

##Is political protest being socialised, or is social protest being politicised?

The large proportion of events attributable to social justice themes (25% of all, 10 out of 41 events) may attest to a new tendency in the protest movement. However, it has to be noted that the short span of time covered by this report and the small selection (41 events) allows for only tentative conclusions. Besides, as we note in [our methodology](http://reports.ovdinfo.org/2012/report/en/#our-data-and-methodology), the classification of protest topics is necessarily somewhat arbitrary. Nonetheless, the trend is notable: during the same period in 2012, OVD-info noted just three events with social themes (7% of all); during the last quarter of 2012, there were no such events at all. During all of 2012, we monitored six such events (less than 3% of all).

*Pic. 3: Comparing topics over time*  

It has to be noted that the tendency is a socialisation of political protest, than the other way round. Political activists took part in most of the social justice themed events covered by this report, that is they took on social justice causes, rather than social protest itself being politicised.

At the same time, general protest themes nearly disappeared from our monitoring during the reporting period. We monitored only two events targeted against Putin, leading to five arrests (for comparison: 6 events and 105 arrests during the same period of 2012, and 11 events and 45 arrests during the preceding period), and one event with two arrestees tied to the campaign for fair elections (16 events and 381 arrests during the same period of 2012, zero during the preceding period). Generally protests are becoming more concrete, and their topics more diverse.

Protest related to political repression and solidarity with political prisoners remains one of the dominant causes, but has also reduced: over the reporting period there were 8 such events with 52 arrests (20% of both the number of events and of arrestees). During the same period in 2012 there were six such events and 43 arrestees (14% and 5% respectively). During the preceding quarter the topic of repressions was the most prevalent: 18 events and 144 arrests (40% and 45% respectively).

##Decreasing and less organised protest - or the popularisation of activism?
 
Without monitoring the attendance at events or any events that did not result in arrests, we can only speak to the decrease in arrests. Qualitative information from our monitoring does not suggest that police tactics have become softer or that less illegal arrests are being made. Therefore it is reasonable to suggest that there are fewer attendees at events, while the number of protests remains stable.

During the reporting period we registered an average of six arrests per event: during the preceding period the same ratio was 7.2, and during the same period in 2012, 18.6. Another contributing factor is the growing number of arrests of individual activists outside of public events.

*Pic. 4: Arrests over time, number of actions over time*  

The already noted trend for more spontaneously organised protest is one of the contributing factors. During the reporting period there were practically no events organised by large institutionalised political players. Spontaneous protests and events without formal organisers attract fewer attendees due to their format, and therefore result in fewer arrests.

At the same time, while large institutional actors are disappearing from protest activity, the number of events is not going down. New, smaller and not institutionally formed groups of activists emerge to take on the functions of organisers, and spontaneous protest activity continues.
